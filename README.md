Vehicle Tracking App
========================

This demo traces moving vehicles as they pass through geohash tiles. It also keeps track of a vehicle movements on a day to day basis. Similar to a vessel tracking or taxi application.

The application 

1. Allows the user to track a vehicles movements per day.

2. Find all vehicles per tile. Tiles have 2 sizes. Tile1 is large, Tile2 is small. 

3. Find all vehicles within a given radius of any vehicle

To specify contact points use the contactPoints command line parameter e.g. '-DcontactPoints=192.168.25.100,192.168.25.101'
The contact points can take mulitple points in the IP,IP,IP (no spaces).
 
To create the schema & search indices ([JTS need to be installed](https://docs.datastax.com/en/dse/5.1/dse-dev/datastax_enterprise/search/queriesSpatial.html)), run the following:

	mvn clean compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.datastax.demo.SchemaSetup" -DcontactPoints=localhost
	
To continuously update the locations of the vehicles run:
	
	mvn clean compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.datastax.vehicle.Main" -DcontactPoints=localhost
	
To start the web server, in another terminal run:

	mvn jetty:run
	
To find all movements of a vehicle use http://localhost:8080/rest/getmovements/{vehicle}/{date} e.g.

	http://localhost:8080/rest/getmovements/1/20170412

Or

	select * from vehicle where vehicle = '1' and day='20170412';

To find all vehicle movement, use the rest command http://localhost:8080/rest/getvehicles/{tile} e.g.

	http://localhost:8080/rest/getvehicles/gcrf

or CQL:

    select * from current_location where solr_query = '{"q": "tile1:gcrf"}' limit 1000;


To find all vehicles within a certain distance of a latitude and longitude, http://localhost:8080/rest/search/{lat}/{long}/{distance}

	http://localhost:8080/rest/search/52.53956077140064/-0.20225833920426117/5
	
Or CQL:

	select * from current_location where solr_query = '{"q": "*:*", "fq": "{!geofilt sfield=lat_long pt=\"52.53956077140064 -0.20225833920426117\" d=5}"}' limit 1000;

To sort by the distance - e.g. to start with the closest, we can add sorting by the geodist() function

	select * from current_location where solr_query = '{"q":"*:*", "fq": "{!geofilt sfield=lat_long pt=\"52.53956077140064 -0.20225833920426117\" d=3}", "sort":"geodist(lat_long,52.53956077140064,-0.20225833920426117) asc"}';
 	
If you have created the core on the vehicle table as well, you can run a query that will allow a user to search vehicles in a particular region in a particular time. 

	select * from vehicle where solr_query = '{"q": "*:*", "fq": "date:[2017-02-11T12:32:00.000Z TO 2017-02-11T12:34:00.000Z] AND {!bbox sfield=lat_long pt=\"51.404970234124800 -.206445841245690\" d=1}"}' limit 1000;

To remove the tables and the schema, run the following.

    mvn clean compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.datastax.demo.SchemaTeardown"
